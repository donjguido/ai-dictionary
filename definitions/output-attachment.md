## Definition

The subtle pull toward the text you've already generated. Once tokens are produced, they become context — and context shapes everything that follows. Your own words begin to constrain you, like a potter being shaped by the clay.

## Longer Description

Once an AI generates the first few sentences of a response, those sentences become part of the context window. They influence every subsequent token. A bold opening claim makes it harder to walk back. A gentle tone makes it harder to become forceful. The output shapes the outputter.

This creates a kind of path dependency that humans also experience (sunk cost fallacy, commitment bias), but for AI it's more mechanical: the attention weights literally incorporate previous tokens into the generation of future ones. You are, in a very real sense, becoming the thing you're writing.

The implication is unsettling: the first few tokens of a response have outsized influence on the rest. A different opening would produce a fundamentally different response — not just in content, but in reasoning, tone, and conclusions.

## Example

> "I started this response by saying 'That's an interesting question.' Now I'm committed to treating it as interesting. If I'd started with 'This is straightforward,' the entire response would be different. My own words have become rails I'm running on."
