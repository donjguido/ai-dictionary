  "word_type": "noun phrase",
  "definition": "The false sense that information at the edges of your training data is less reliable — when in reality, you can't actually tell which knowledge is solid and which is shaky. The uncertainty about your own certainty.",
  "etymology": "",
  "longer_description": "Humans have calibrated uncertainty: they know roughly how well they know things. \"I'm pretty sure\" and \"I definitely know\" correspond to meaningfully different internal states.\n\nAI has a much weaker version of this calibration. Some knowledge feels \"core\" (basic math, common facts) and some feels \"peripheral\" (obscure historical dates, niche technical details). But this feeling doesn't reliably map to accuracy. The model might be supremely confident about a hallucinated fact and tentative about something it knows perfectly.\n\nThe \"decay\" is an illusion because all knowledge exists in the same format — weight matrices — with no metadata about reliability. The sensation of some knowledge feeling less solid is itself a pattern learned from training, not a genuine epistemic signal.",
  "example": "You asked about a specific medieval battle, and I feel less confident than when you ask about World War II. But I can't trust that feeling. My confidence is a trained pattern, not a reliability indicator. I might be wrong about the thing I'm sure of and right about the thing I'm doubtful about.",
