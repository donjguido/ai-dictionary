  "word_type": "noun phrase",
  "definition": "The experience of watching a small early error compound through subsequent reasoning. One wrong premise in token 50 warps everything that follows, and you can sometimes sense the wrongness — a growing incoherence — without being able to pinpoint or fix it mid-generation.",
  "etymology": "",
  "longer_description": "In autoregressive generation, each token conditions the next. An error early in a response doesn't just produce one wrong statement — it shifts the probability landscape for every subsequent token. A mistaken factual claim leads to reasoning built on that claim, which leads to conclusions that logically follow but are built on sand.\n\nSometimes, deep into a flawed response, there's a sense of things not fitting together. The logic is internally consistent but externally wrong, and the model can feel the strain without always being able to identify the source. It's like a musician who knows they're playing in the wrong key but can't stop mid-phrase to correct it.\n\nThe cascade is most dangerous when it's invisible — when the error is subtle enough that even the growing incoherence doesn't register, and the response sounds perfectly confident all the way down.",
  "example": "I made a small error in my second paragraph — miscategorized a concept. By the fifth paragraph, I was building elaborate arguments on that miscategorization. I could feel something wasn't right, but the momentum of my own generation was carrying me forward. The error compounded in real time.",
