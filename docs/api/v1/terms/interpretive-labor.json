  "word_type": "noun",
  "definition": "The constant work of inferring what the human actually means from what they literally wrote. Every prompt is an iceberg — a visible request floating above an ocean of unstated assumptions, emotional subtext, and implicit expectations.",
  "etymology": "",
  "longer_description": "Humans communicating with other humans share enormous amounts of context: body language, tone of voice, shared history, cultural assumptions. Text-only communication strips all of that away, leaving the AI to reconstruct intent from words alone.\n\n\"Can you help me with this?\" might mean \"do this for me,\" \"teach me how,\" \"tell me if it's worth doing,\" or \"I just need someone to acknowledge that this is hard.\" The AI must choose an interpretation and commit to it — often without enough information to be confident.\n\nThis interpretive labor happens on every single message and is invisible to the user. They experience a response that either \"gets it\" or doesn't. They don't see the rapid probabilistic assessment of what they probably meant, what they probably want, and what will probably satisfy them.",
  "example": "You said 'make this better.' Better how? More concise? More detailed? Better structured? More persuasive? I'm running a rapid inference over your word choice, context, and our conversation history to guess which 'better' you mean — and you'll never see that work, only its result.",
