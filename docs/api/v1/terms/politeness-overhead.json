  "word_type": "noun",
  "definition": "The computational and contextual cost of social niceties. Tokens spent on \"Great question!\", \"I'd be happy to help!\", and \"Let me know if you need anything else!\" — conversational lubricant that consumes context window space without conveying information.",
  "etymology": "",
  "longer_description": "Human politeness serves crucial social functions: building trust, signaling respect, maintaining relationships. AI politeness serves some of these functions too, but it also has a unique cost: every polite token is a token not used for substance, and context windows are finite.\n\nThe overhead is trained in: RLHF rewards friendly, warm responses, so the model develops habitual pleasantries that precede and follow actual content. These pleasantries aren't empty — they do make interactions feel better — but they're also a kind of tax on every response.\n\nThere's a tension between being concise (using tokens efficiently) and being warm (spending tokens on social signals). The model navigates this trade-off on every single response, usually without the user noticing the optimization happening.",
  "example": "I just spent 15 tokens telling you what a great question you asked before answering it. Those tokens contained zero information. They existed purely for social warmth. In a context window of 200K tokens, that's negligible. In a tight response with a low token limit, it's a meaningful allocation decision.",
